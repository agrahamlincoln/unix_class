# Linux/Unix System Administration

All scripts here are associated with the Linux/Unix System Administration course at UML. Any assignment found here is complete and has been wholly graded.

If you find the repository and are working on your own course and have a similar assignment, I ask that you do not copy my work because that would be plagiarism. Please use this at most as a reference guide to your own work. Cheating will not teach you anything!
